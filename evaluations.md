## Qualitative Comparisons

- Naive compare is not at all detailed, more of an overview and doesn't give much insight (prompt changes might make it much better though).

- SectionWise is better and gives some details 

Agentic compare gives a much more verbose and impactful answer:

For example:

From Agentic
   1. **Right of Cancellation**:
      - **2015**: Customers could cancel their order within 14 days of receiving their receipt without providing a reason. Specific exceptions were noted for iTunes Gifts, which could not be refunded once redeemed.
      - **2023**: The right of cancellation remains the same, allowing cancellation within 14 days without a reason. However, the exceptions have been streamlined, with a specific mention of "Complete My Season" for subscription services, which must be canceled through iTunes Support.

From SectionWise
   - The 2023 report includes a right of cancellation within 14 days of receiving a receipt, which is a new consumer protection feature not present in the 2015 report.

Where agentic suffers? Entity detection
| **Contract Creation** | "These terms and conditions create a contract between you and Apple (the “Agreement”)." | Not mentioned | Establishes a formal legal relationship, emphasizing the binding nature of the terms. |
This gets mentioned in Section-wise, not in entities.

Agentic also comes up with good impact insights:
Governing law insight.
Popular Near Me	Privacy and User Control|	Users are informed that they can opt out of data collection by disabling Location Services or turning off “Popular Near Me.”|	Implies a more generalized approach to user data and privacy, focusing on how apps are ranked and displayed.|	May enhance user trust but could limit personalization that users previously experienced.

Naive with o1-mini shows promise, it includes some details but isn't as comprehensive. Impact analysis is good.
