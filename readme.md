##Semantic Redliner

#Observations
- The texts are pretty small
- 8193 words, 15105 words
- So they are also very different to each other - traditional redlining will likely fail.

#Plan
- First lets just pass it all into gpt4o and see what it says. That is baseline.
- Next lets do entity extraction and semantic chunking to see what the layouts are and compare section wise.
- Then we go for multihop QA tool can reach into web to get sources to expand knowledge.
