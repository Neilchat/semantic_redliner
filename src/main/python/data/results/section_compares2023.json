This indicates a broader scope in 2015, which is not explicitly mentioned in 2023.\n\n3. **Modification of Usage Rules**:\n   - **2023 Report**: iTunes reserves the right to modify the Usage Rules for future purchases at any time, and changes will not apply to products already purchased.\n   - **2015 Report**: This is consistent with the 2023 report, but it emphasizes that changes will be communicated to the user.\n\n4. **Compliance with Usage Rules**:\n   - **2023 Report**: Users must comply with the applicable usage rules established by iTunes and its licensors.\n   - **2015 Report**: Similar compliance language is present, but it includes \"the Publishers,\" indicating a broader responsibility in 2015.\n\n5. **Personal, Noncommercial Use**:\n   - **2023 Report**: Not explicitly mentioned in the provided 2023 text.\n   - **2015 Report**: States that users are authorized to use iTunes Products only for personal, noncommercial use. This specific limitation is missing in the 2023 report.\n\n6. **Device Limitations**:\n   - **2023 Report**: Not explicitly mentioned in the provided 2023 text.\n   - **2015 Report**: Details on the number of computers and devices that can be used with iTunes Products are provided, which are not present in the 2023 report.\n\n7. **Burning Audio Playlists**:\n   - **2023 Report**: Not explicitly mentioned in the provided 2023 text.\n   - **2015 Report**: Specifies the ability to burn an audio playlist up to seven times, which is not included in the 2023 report.\n\n8. **HDCP Connection Requirement**:\n   - **2023 Report**: Not explicitly mentioned in the provided 2023 text.\n   - **2015 Report**: Mentions that an HDCP connection is required to view films and TV shows transmitted over HDMI, which is absent in the 2023 report.\n\nIn summary, the 2023 report appears to have omitted specific details regarding personal use limitations, device limitations, and burning audio playlists that were present in the 2015 report.

The 2015 report does not mention any requirement for user consent in the event of a price increase.\n\n4. **Charge Timing**: The 2023 report specifies that users will be charged no more than 24 hours prior to the start of the latest Paid Subscription period. The 2015 report states that the account will be charged no more than 24 hours prior to the expiration of the current In-App Subscription period, which implies a different timing context.\n\n5. **Responsibility for Uncollected Amounts**: The 2023 report states that if the payment method cannot be charged, the user remains responsible for any uncollected amounts. The 2015 report does not contain a similar statement regarding responsibility for uncollected amounts.\n\n6. **Free Trial Reactivation**: The 2023 report states that if a user cancels an Apple Paid Subscription before the free trial ends, they cannot reactivate the free trial. The 2015 report does not mention this restriction.\n\n7. **Combination of Free Trials**: The 2023 report specifies that free trials or offers for Apple Paid Subscriptions cannot be combined with any free trials or offers of Apple One. This is not addressed in the 2015 report.\n\n8. **Expiration of Free Trials**: The 2023 report mentions that free trials or offers may expire while a user is a Paid Subscriber to Apple One, and Apple has no obligation to reinstate or compensate for expired trials. The 2015 report does not include this information.\n\n9. **Loss of Access**: The 2023 report states that when a Paid Subscription ends, users will lose access to any functionality or content that requires a Paid Subscription. The 2015 report does not explicitly mention this loss of access upon subscription termination. \n\nThese points highlight significant changes or omissions between the 2023 and 2015 reports regarding subscription terms and conditions.",

This fact is missing in the 2015 report.\n\n2. **Provider of the Stores**:\n   - **2023 Fact**: The report implies that Apple is the provider of the Stores.\n   - **2015 Report**: The 2015 report states that \"iTunes is the provider of the Stores.\" This indicates a significant change in terminology, as it specifies \"iTunes\" rather than \"Apple.\"\n\n3. **Types of Users**:\n   - **2023 Fact**: The report mentions that end users may be individuals, commercial enterprises, or educational institutions.\n   - **2015 Report**: This fact is present in the 2015 report, which also states that end users may be individuals acting in their own capacities, or commercial enterprises or educational institutions. There is no significant change here.\n\n4. **Products Definition**:\n   - **2023 Fact**: The report refers to App Store Products and iBooks Store Products collectively as \u201cProducts.\u201d\n   - **2015 Report**: This definition is also present in the 2015 report, where it refers to App Store Products and iBooks Store Products together as \u201cProducts.\u201d There is no significant change here.\n\n5. **Maintenance and Support**:\n   - **2023 Fact**: The report outlines responsibilities for maintenance and support services.\n   - **2015 Report**: The 2015 report contains similar information regarding maintenance and support services, specifying responsibilities for iTunes and third-party products.

The term \"Services\" in 2023 is replaced by \"Stores\" in 2015. This indicates a shift in branding and possibly the scope of services.\n\n2. **Communication of Modifications**: \n   - **2023 Statement**: \"Such modifications and additional terms and conditions will be communicated to you and, if accepted, will be effective immediately and will be incorporated into this Agreement.\"\n   - **2015 Report**: \"Such modifications and additional terms and conditions will be communicated to you and, if accepted, will be effective immediately and will be incorporated into this Agreement.\"\n   - **Change**: This statement is consistent between both reports.\n\n3. **Refusal to Accept Changes**: \n   - **2023 Statement**: \"In the event you refuse to accept such changes, Apple will have the right to terminate the Agreement.\"\n   - **2015 Report**: \"In the event that you refuse to accept such changes, iTunes will have the right to terminate the Agreement.\"\n   - **Change**: Similar to the first point, the term \"Apple\" is used in 2023, while \"iTunes\" is used in 2015. \n\n4. **Termination Rights**: \n   - **2023 Statement**: \"Apple will have the right to terminate the Agreement.\"\n   - **2015 Report**: \"iTunes will have the right to terminate the Agreement.\"\n   - **Change**: Again, the shift from \"iTunes\" to \"Apple\" indicates a branding change.\n\n5. **Additional Information**: \n   - **2023 Report**: Does not include any additional clauses or conditions regarding the modification or termination process.\n   - **2015 Report**: Contains additional information regarding the termination process, including the rights of iTunes to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Stores, and the lack of liability for such actions.\n   - **Change**: The 2023 report is more concise and does not elaborate on the termination process as extensively as the 2015 report.\n\nOverall, the significant changes primarily revolve around the branding shift from \"iTunes\" to \"Apple,\" while the core concepts regarding modifications and terminations remain consistent. The 2023 report is more streamlined and lacks the additional details present in the 2015 report.",
