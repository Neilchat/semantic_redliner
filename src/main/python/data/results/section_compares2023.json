    "comparison": "1. **Terminology and Scope**: \n   - In 2023, the term \"Services\" is used broadly to encompass various offerings such as App Store, Apple Arcade, Apple Music, etc., while in 2015, the focus was primarily on the iTunes Store and its associated services. The 2023 report reflects a more comprehensive range of services beyond just iTunes.\n\n2. **Home Country Specification**: \n   - The 2023 report introduces the concept of specifying a \"Home Country\" when creating an account for the Services, which is not mentioned in the 2015 report.\n\n3. **Age Restrictions**: \n   - The 2023 report does not specify age restrictions for account creation, whereas the 2015 report explicitly states that only persons aged 13 years or older can create accounts, and provides guidelines for accounts created for persons under 13.\n\n4. **Geographic Availability**: \n   - The 2023 report does not limit the availability of Services to a specific country (e.g., the United Kingdom as mentioned in the 2015 report), indicating a broader availability of Services.\n\n5. **Performance Factors**: \n   - The 2023 report mentions that the performance of Services may be affected by factors such as hardware, software, and Internet access, which is a more generalized statement compared to the specific requirements and recommendations outlined in the 2015 report.\n\n6. **Content Definition**: \n   - The 2023 report uses the term \"Content\" to refer to a broader range of offerings, including Apps and in-app services, while the 2015 report primarily refers to \"iTunes Products\" and \"Products\" in a more limited context.\n\nThese changes reflect a shift in Apple's service offerings and user engagement strategies from 2015 to 2023, indicating a more integrated and expansive approach to digital content and services.",

In 2015, it states that once you have authenticated, you will be able to acquire additional In-App Purchases for fifteen minutes without re-entering your password, but does not mention the option to require a password for every purchase.\n\n4. **Loss Liability**: The 2023 report does not include a statement about iTunes being without liability in the event of any loss, destruction, or damage of a consumable In-App Purchase, which is present in the 2015 report.\n\n5. **Turning Off In-App Purchases**: In 2023, it provides a link to instructions for turning off In-App Purchases, while in 2015, it describes the process as going to Settings, selecting \u201cGeneral,\u201d and then selecting the \u201cRestrictions\u201d tab.\n\nThese are the significant changes observed between the 2023 and 2015 reports regarding In-App Purchases.",

In 2015, it stated that the license to any Apple Product is granted by iTunes, and the license to any Third-Party Product is granted by the Publisher.
