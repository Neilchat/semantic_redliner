    "comparison": "The 2015 report contains the following important statements or facts:\n\n1. **Definition of Apple**: The report likely included a definition of \"Apple\" that specified the entity responsible for the services.\n2. **Content and Service Availability**: There were terms regarding the availability of services and content based on the user's Home Country.\n3. **In-App Purchases**: There were terms related to in-app purchases, including authentication requirements and transferability of in-app content.\n\nNow, let's compare these facts with the 2023 report:\n\n1. **Definition of Apple**: The 2023 report includes a section titled \"DEFINITION OF APPLE,\" which suggests that this fact is still present. However, without the specific wording from the 2015 report, we cannot determine if there are any significant changes.\n\n2. **Content and Service Availability**: The 2023 report contains a section on \"CONTENT AND SERVICE AVAILABILITY\" that discusses the applicability of terms based on the user's Home Country. This indicates that the core concept is still present, but we cannot ascertain if there are significant changes without the original wording from 2015.\n\n3. **In-App Purchases**: The 2023 report includes a detailed section on \"IN-APP PURCHASES,\" which outlines authentication requirements and conditions for making purchases. This suggests that the concept is still present, but again, we cannot determine if there are significant changes without the original wording from 2015.\n\n**Missing or Changed Statements**:\n- Since the 2015 report is not provided in detail, we cannot definitively identify any missing or significantly changed statements in the 2023 report based on the information given. \n\n**Conclusion**: The 2023 report retains the core concepts of the 2015 report regarding the definition of Apple, content and service availability, and in-app purchases, but without the original text from 2015, we cannot identify specific changes or omissions.",

    "comparison": "1. **Name Change**: The service referred to as \"iTunes Match\" in 2015 is now referred to as \"iCloud Music Library\" in 2023. This indicates a significant rebranding and possibly a shift in service structure.\n\n2. **Content Access**: In 2015, iTunes Match allowed access to matched or uploaded songs and music videos purchased with your Account. In 2023, iCloud Music Library allows access to matched or uploaded songs, playlists, and music videos acquired from Apple Music, the iTunes Store, or another source. This expands the sources of content available to users.\n\n3. **Upload Limit**: The upload limit for songs has changed from 25,000 songs in 2015 to 100,000 songs in 2023, significantly increasing the capacity for users.\n\n4. **Automatic Activation**: In 2023, iCloud Music Library is turned on automatically when setting up an Apple Music membership, which was not mentioned in the 2015 report.\n\n5. **Data Collection**: The 2023 report specifies that iCloud Music Library collects information about the content and logs information such as tracks played, stopped, or skipped, which was not detailed in the 2015 report.\n\n6. **Loss of Access**: In 2023, it is stated that if you are not an Apple Music member, you may purchase an iTunes Match subscription, which uses iCloud Music Library. This implies a change in how the service is accessed compared to 2015.\n\n7. **Service Provision**: The 2023 report states that iCloud Music Library is provided on an \"AS IS\" basis and could contain errors or inaccuracies, similar to the 2015 report, but it does not mention the potential for data loss or corruption as explicitly as in 2015.\n\n8. **Genius Feature**: The 2015 report mentions that Genius will begin associating information about the media in your iTunes library with your Account and that you cannot disable Genius while using iTunes Match. This specific mention of Genius is absent in the 2023 report.\n\n9. **Legal Compliance**: The 2015 report explicitly states that users agree to use iTunes Match only for lawfully acquired content and warns against the use of illegitimate content. The 2023 report does not include this specific warning.\n\n10. **Liability Disclaimer**: The 2015 report includes a disclaimer about iTunes having no liability with respect to the use of iTunes Match. The 2023 report does not contain a similar liability disclaimer for iCloud Music Library.\n\nThese changes reflect a significant evolution in the service, its features, and its terms of use from 2015 to 2023.",

    "comparison": "1. **Terminology Change**: The term \"In-App Subscriptions\" in the 2015 report has been changed to \"Paid Subscriptions\" in the 2023 report. This is a significant change in terminology.\n\n2. **Cancellation Process**: The 2015 report states that you may cancel automatic renewal of paid In-App Subscriptions by selecting Manage App Subscriptions in your Account. The 2023 report also mentions cancelling subscriptions in the Manage Subscriptions section of your account settings, but it does not specify the same process as in 2015. The 2023 report provides a link for more information on cancelling subscriptions, which was not present in the 2015 report.\n\n3. **Price Increase Notification**: The 2015 report states that the auto-renew feature will be turned off if the Publisher increases the price of the subscription. The 2023 report states that you will be notified if the price of a Paid Subscription increases and that your consent will be required to continue. This indicates a change in the process regarding price increases.\n\n4. **Payment Method Issues**: The 2023 report introduces a new clause regarding what happens if Apple cannot charge your payment method for any reason, stating that you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and that Apple will attempt to charge the payment method as you may update your payment method information. This information was not present in the 2015 report.\n\n5. **Free Trial Conditions**: The 2015 report mentions that certain paid In-App Subscriptions may offer a free trial period prior to charging your Account.

This adds a new condition regarding free trials that was not present in the 2015 report.\n\n6. **Loss of Access**: The 2023 report states that when your Paid Subscription to any Service or Content ends, you will lose access to any functionality or Content of that Service that requires a Paid Subscription. This specific mention of losing access upon subscription end was not explicitly stated in the 2015 report.\n\n7. **Refund Policy**: The 2015 report mentions that refunds are available as set out in their refund policy, but the 2023 report provides a more detailed explanation of the right of cancellation and the process for refunds, including a 14-day cancellation period and conditions under which you cannot cancel. This represents a significant expansion and change in the refund policy.\n\n8. **Marketing Information Sharing**: The 2015 report includes a clause about sharing your personal information with the Publisher for marketing purposes. There is no mention of this in the 2023 report, indicating that this aspect may have been removed or changed.\n\nOverall, the 2023 report contains several significant changes and additions compared to the 2015 report, particularly regarding terminology, cancellation processes, payment issues, free trial conditions, access loss, and refund policies.",
