In the 2023 report, it specifies that if you pre-order Content, you will be charged when the Content is delivered to you (unless you cancel prior to the Content\u2019s availability). This indicates a change in the timing of when the charge occurs.\n\n2. **Cancellation Policy**: The 2015 report allows cancellation of a pre-order anytime prior to the item becoming available. The 2023 report introduces a more detailed cancellation policy, stating that you may cancel your order within 14 days of receiving your receipt, and it outlines the process for cancellation and the effects of cancellation, which were not specified in the 2015 report.\n\n3. **Refund Process**: The 2023 report includes a specific timeframe for reimbursement (no later than 14 days from the cancellation notice) and states that the same means of payment will be used for reimbursement without incurring any fees. This level of detail regarding refunds is not present in the 2015 report.\n\n4. **Right of Cancellation**: The 2023 report explicitly states the right of cancellation and provides a model cancellation form, which was not included in the 2015 report.\n\nThese changes reflect a more detailed and structured approach to pre-orders, cancellations, and refunds in the 2023 report compared to the 2015 report.",

This detail about the default status of Ask to Buy is not present in the 2015 report.\n\n6. **Content Access After Leaving Family**: The 2023 report emphasizes that when a Family member leaves or is removed from the Family, the remaining members may no longer access the former member\u2019s content, which is a more explicit statement compared to the 2015 report.\n\n7. **Home Country Requirement**: The 2023 report states that all Family members must share the same \"Home Country,\" which is a new requirement not mentioned in the 2015 report.\n\n8. **Subscription Services**: The 2023 report lists specific subscription services (e.g., Apple TV+, Apple Music Family, etc.) that are automatically enabled for Family Sharing, which was not detailed in the 2015 report.\n\nThese changes reflect a more structured and detailed approach to Family Sharing in the 2023 report compared to the 2015 version.",

In 2023, the agreement is described as an electronic contract between the user and Apple and/or the entity providing the Content, indicating a shift in the contractual relationship.\n\n2. **Security Framework and Usage Rules**: The 2015 report emphasized the existence of a \"Security Framework\" and \"Usage Rules\" established by iTunes and the Publishers. The 2023 report does not mention a specific \"Security Framework\" or the same detailed \"Usage Rules,\" indicating a potential change in how these concepts are presented or enforced.\n\n3. **Modification of Usage Rules**: The 2015 report stated that iTunes reserves the right to modify the Usage Rules for future purchases at any time, but such changes would not apply to Products already purchased. The 2023 report does not include this provision, suggesting a change in how modifications to terms may be handled.\n\n4. **Cancellation Rights**: The 2015 report did not mention specific cancellation rights or procedures.

This concept was not present in the 2015 report.\n\n5. **Limitation of Liability**: \n   - The 2023 report includes a section on \"Limitation of Liability,\" which was not present in the 2015 report.\n\n6. **Clarification on Responsibility**: \n   - The 2023 report emphasizes that the App Provider of any Third Party App is solely responsible for its content, warranties, and claims, subject to local law, which is a more explicit statement compared to the 2015 report.\n\n7. **Third-Party Beneficiary**: \n   - The 2023 report states that Apple is a third-party beneficiary of the Standard EULA or Custom EULA applicable to each Third Party App, which is a more explicit acknowledgment compared to the 2015 report.\n\nThese changes reflect a shift in the language and structure of the agreements, as well as a clearer delineation of responsibilities between Apple, App Providers, and users.",

This simplifies the language used to describe the applications.\n\n2. **Authentication Methods**: In 2015, authentication for In-App Purchases was limited to entering a password. In 2023, users can also authenticate using Touch ID or Face ID, providing more options for security and convenience.\n\n3. **Re-authentication Conditions**: The 2023 report specifies that users can make additional In-App Purchases for fifteen minutes without re-authenticating unless they have requested a password for every purchase or have enabled Touch ID or Face ID. This adds clarity regarding user control over authentication settings.\n\n4. **Removal of Liability Clause**: The 2015 report included a clause stating that iTunes shall be without liability in the event of loss, destruction, or damage of consumable In-App Purchases. This clause is absent in the 2023 report, indicating a potential shift in liability terms.\n\n5. **Link to Support Instructions**: The link provided for turning off In-App Purchases has changed from http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213 in 2015 to https://support.apple.com/HT201304 in 2023, reflecting an update in the support documentation.\n\nThese changes reflect a shift towards more user-friendly authentication methods, a clarification of user control over purchase settings, and a potential change in liability terms.",
