This indicates a broader scope in 2015, which is not explicitly mentioned in 2023.\n\n3. **Modification of Usage Rules**:\n   - **2023 Report**: iTunes reserves the right to modify the Usage Rules for future purchases at any time, and such changes will not apply to products already purchased.\n   - **2015 Report**: This is consistent with the 2023 report, indicating no significant change.\n\n4. **Communication of Changes**:\n   - **2023 Report**: Any change to the Usage Rules will be communicated to the user.\n   - **2015 Report**: This is also present, indicating no significant change.\n\n5. **Refusal of New Usage Rules**:\n   - **2023 Report**: If the user refuses to accept the new Usage Rules, they will no longer be able to acquire iTunes Products.\n   - **2015 Report**: This is consistent with the 2023 report, indicating no significant change.\n\n6. **Usage Rules Specifics**:\n   - **2023 Report**: Specific details about usage rules (e.g., number of devices, burning limitations) are not provided in the 2023 report.\n   - **2015 Report**: Contains detailed usage rules, including specifics about the number of computers, devices, and burning limitations. These details are missing in the 2023 report.\n\n7. **iTunes Plus Products**:\n   - **2023 Report**: No mention of iTunes Plus Products.\n   - **2015 Report**: Contains specific rules regarding iTunes Plus Products, including that they do not contain security technology that limits usage. This information is absent in the 2023 report.\n\nIn summary, the 2023 report lacks specific details about usage rules and iTunes Plus Products that were present in the 2015 report.
