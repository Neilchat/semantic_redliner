    "comparison": "1. **iTunes Match Content Definition**: The 2015 report refers to \"iTunes Match Content\" as matched or uploaded songs, music videos purchased with your Account, and related metadata. The 2023 report does not mention iTunes Match or its content, instead introducing \"iCloud Music Library Content\" which includes songs, playlists, and music videos acquired from Apple Music, the iTunes Store, or another source.\n\n2. **Subscription Fee and Terms**: The 2015 report states that you may subscribe to iTunes Match for an annual fee, which is non-refundable and automatically renews until canceled.

The 2023 report similarly advises backing up data before using iCloud Music Library, but does not reference iTunes Match.\n\n7. **Lawful Use Agreement**: The 2015 report states that users agree to use iTunes Match only for lawfully acquired content. The 2023 report includes a similar statement regarding iCloud Music Library, but does not reference iTunes Match.\n\n8. **Access After Subscription Ends**: The 2015 report states that you will no longer be able to access your iTunes Match Content after the end of your subscription period. The 2023 report states that when your Apple Music membership ends, you will lose access to your iCloud Music Library, including content uploaded to iCloud Music Library servers, but does not mention iTunes Match.\n\nOverall, the 2023 report introduces iCloud Music Library as a new feature while omitting or significantly altering many aspects of iTunes Match as described in the 2015 report.",
