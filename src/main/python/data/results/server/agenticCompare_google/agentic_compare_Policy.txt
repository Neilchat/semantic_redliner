   - **Document 2**: Does not explicitly mention indemnity in the context of consumer rights, focusing instead on the rights of individual users.

   **Impact**: The indemnity clause in Document 1 may deter businesses from using the services due to potential liabilities, while Document 2's omission of such clauses may encourage more individual users to engage with the services without fear of legal repercussions.

5. **Modification of Terms**:
   - **Document 1**: States that terms may be modified to reflect changes in law or services, with a notice period of fourteen days.
   - **Document 2**: Similar provisions exist, but it emphasizes that changes will not affect rights that cannot be limited by contract.

### Conclusion
Overall, while both documents recognize consumer legal rights, Document 1 provides a more detailed framework regarding personal versus business use, while Document 2 focuses on clarity and local legal applicability, particularly for UK users. The differences in language, jurisdiction, and indemnity clauses can significantly impact consumer understanding and protection under the terms of service.
