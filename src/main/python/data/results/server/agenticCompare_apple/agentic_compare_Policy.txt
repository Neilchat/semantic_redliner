__________________Termination Policy_____________________

### Summary of Differences in Termination Policy

1. **Authority to Terminate**:
   - **Document 1 (iTunes)**: iTunes reserves the right to terminate the Agreement and/or the user's account at its sole discretion without notice if the user fails to comply with any provisions of the Agreement. This includes the ability to terminate licenses to software and preclude access to the Stores.
   - **Document 2 (Licensor)**: Apple (Licensor) similarly retains the right to terminate the Agreement and/or the user's Apple ID without notice if there is a failure to comply with the Agreement. However, it explicitly states that the user's rights under the Standard EULA will terminate automatically upon non-compliance.

   **Impact**: Both documents grant significant authority to the service provider to terminate agreements, but Document 2 emphasizes automatic termination of rights, which may lead to less ambiguity for users regarding the consequences of non-compliance.

2. **Notification of Termination**:
   - **Document 1**: iTunes states that it may warn users in advance of any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Stores, but does not explicitly mention notification for termination.
   - **Document 2**: Apple also reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue services with or without notice, but similarly does not guarantee prior notification for termination.

   **Impact**: Both documents lack a clear commitment to notify users before termination, which could lead to unexpected service interruptions for users. This could be significant for users who rely on the services for ongoing access to content.

3. **Liability Post-Termination**:
   - **Document 1**: Users remain liable for all amounts due under their account up to the date of termination, and termination does not affect previously acquired products.
   - **Document 2**: Similar to Document 1, users remain liable for amounts due under their Apple ID, and termination does not affect previously acquired content.

   **Impact**: Both documents ensure that users are held accountable for any outstanding payments even after termination, which protects the service provider's financial interests. This consistency across both documents reinforces the importance of compliance with payment obligations.

4. **Scope of Termination**:
   - **Document 1**: iTunes mentions the ability to terminate access to the Stores or any part thereof, indicating a broader scope of potential termination.
   - **Document 2**: Apple specifies termination of access to the Services, which may imply a more focused scope compared to the broader "Stores" mentioned in Document 1.

   **Impact**: The broader language in Document 1 may allow for more extensive actions against users, potentially affecting a wider range of services and content. This could lead to greater uncertainty for users regarding what specific services might be impacted.

### Conclusion
Both documents provide similar frameworks for termination policies, emphasizing the service provider's authority to terminate agreements based on user non-compliance. However, the differences in language regarding notification, automatic termination, and the scope of termination could have significant implications for users, particularly in terms of clarity and expectations around service continuity and compliance. Users should be aware of these nuances to better understand their rights and obligations under each agreement.

   - **Document 2**: Expands on payment methods by allowing users to associate multiple payment methods with their Apple ID. It specifies that if the primary payment method fails, Apple may attempt to charge other eligible methods in a specified order. This provides users with more flexibility and security in managing their payments.

2. **Cancellation Rights**:
   - **Document 1**: Allows cancellation within 14 days of receipt without reason, with specific exceptions for certain products like iTunes Gifts. It emphasizes the need to inform iTunes of the cancellation decision.

This distinction is significant for users who may be subscribing to services, as it clarifies their rights regarding ongoing subscriptions.

3. **Refund Policy**:
   - **Document 1**: States that if a product becomes unavailable after purchase but before download, the remedy is limited to a refund of the price paid. It also mentions that technical problems may lead to either a replacement or a refund.

This clause introduces a layer of protection for Apple against potential misuse, which could impact users who may inadvertently trigger such actions.

4. **Price Changes**:
   - **Document 1**: Indicates that prices can change at any time and that there is no price protection or refunds for price reductions after purchase.
   - **Document 2**: Echoes this sentiment but does not elaborate further. The lack of price protection in both documents signifies that users should be aware that they may not benefit from lower prices after their purchase, which could affect purchasing decisions.

5. **Electronic Invoices**:
   - Both documents agree on the receipt of invoices in electronic format, but Document 2 provides a more comprehensive link to additional resources regarding store credit and gift cards, enhancing user access to related information.

   - **Document 2**: Also allows cancellation within 14 days but emphasizes that subscription services can only be canceled following the initial subscription and not upon each automatic renewal.
   - **Impact**: The inclusion of subscription service cancellation terms in Document 2 clarifies the process for consumers who may be subscribing to services, potentially reducing confusion about cancellation rights for ongoing subscriptions.

3. **Communication of Cancellation**:
   - **Document 1**: Recommends using "Report a Problem" for immediate processing of cancellations.
   - **Document 2**: Similarly recommends using "Report a Problem" but adds that acknowledgment of receipt will be communicated without delay.
   - **Impact**: The emphasis on acknowledgment in Document 2 may provide consumers with more assurance that their cancellation request has been received and is being processed.

4. **Effects of Cancellation**:
   - Both documents state that reimbursement will occur no later than 14 days from receipt of the cancellation notice, using the same payment method without incurring fees.
   - **Impact**: This consistency ensures that consumers are aware of their rights regarding refunds, which is crucial for maintaining trust in the company's practices.

5. **Exceptions to Cancellation Rights**:
   - Both documents mention that cancellation rights are lost if the delivery of digital content has started upon the consumer's request.
   - **Impact**: This clause protects the company from losses due to early access to digital content, but it also highlights the importance for consumers to understand the implications of their requests.

### Conclusion
The differences between the two documents regarding the Model Cancellation Form reflect changes in the legal entity responsible for cancellations, clarify the cancellation process for subscription services, and emphasize the importance of acknowledgment of cancellation requests. These changes could significantly impact consumer understanding and rights, particularly for those engaging with subscription services.
